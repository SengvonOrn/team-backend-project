⚖️ Compare Methods
Method	Description	Pros	Cons	Best For
Run Prisma from host (localhost)	Use npx prisma migrate dev on your local machine	Easier for debugging and editing schema quickly	Must have localhost:5432 DB port open	Early development / prototyping
Run Prisma inside Docker container	Use docker compose exec nestjs_api npx prisma migrate dev	Works exactly like production, same env	Slightly slower to run	Team development & production
Auto-run in Dockerfile or entrypoint	Prisma runs automatically when container starts	Always in sync, zero manual steps	Less control (can slow down rebuilds)	CI/CD pipelines, testing environments
